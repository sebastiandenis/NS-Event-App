It is backed into the Angular core and also used in frameworks like React, Vue, and others! \nThis doesn't surprise as it leverages a powerful and elegant way to work with sync as well as async collections. \n\nIn this workshop, you will get a really deep and complete knowledge of this library. We will learn about the big and little things that make the difference in understanding! After a practical and detailed tour from creation to the destruction of observables we will work on some concepts like multicasting, custom pipes and higher order observables. \nAs the last exercise, we will solve a couple of real-life problems in a complete example from start to end. Sounds interesting? \n\nLooking forward to meeting you at the workshop. \n\nThis workshop is provided by angular-college.com\n\nCourse overview:\n- Conceptual (unknown) introduction to Rx\n- Execution context and observables\n- Subscription handling, explicit and implicit\n- Error handling and tricks to encapsulate errors\n- Memory leaks, how to find and avoid them\n- Most handy pipes in comparison\n- Custom configurable pipes\n- Multicasting with observables\n- Subjects and their differences\n- Higher order Observables comparison and best usage\n\nPrerequisites:\n- The workshop requires good understanding of JavaScript.",
